# Diabetes Prediction with Pima Indians Diabetes Database using K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN)
In this project, I applied the KNN Model, one of the Machine Learning models, using the Pima Indians Diabetes Database in Python.

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

The datasets consist of several medical predictor (independent) variables and one target (dependent) variable, Outcome. Independent variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

- Further hyperparameter optimizations can be done.
- Scaling and Normalization techniques can be tested.
- Missing values can be filled with KNNImputer or SimpleImputer.
- Different visualizations can be done.
